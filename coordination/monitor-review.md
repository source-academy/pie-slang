# Monitor Review

This file contains feedback from the monitor agent.

---

## Review Criteria

1. **Code Structure** - Is the structure clear and logical? Does it match the architecture docs?
2. **No Simplifications** - No shortcuts, workarounds, or "good enough" solutions
3. **No Workarounds** - If something requires a proper solution, do it right
4. **Specification Compliance** - Strict adherence to docs/react-frontend-architecture.md and docs/interactive-proof-design.md
5. **Type Safety** - Proper TypeScript types, no `any` escapes
6. **Completeness** - Handle all cases, not just happy paths

## Policy

If a plan requires something that:
- Needs user input or decision
- Requires changes outside the frontend scope
- Has architectural implications beyond the current task

The agent will be instructed to **STOP and WAIT** for user resolution.
